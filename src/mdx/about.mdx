I'm a thirty-something year old misfit who plays too much disc golf and regularly explores his creative side through woodworking, 3D printing, coding applications & whatever else that interests me. I built this blog after being inspired by my incredibly-talented front end coworkers, in order to share both the work that I'm doing, and the work of the amazing artists that are in my life.
