I'm a thirty-something year old misfit who plays too much disc golf and regularly explores his creative side through woodworking, 3D printing, coding applications & whatever else that interests me. I built this blog after being inspired by my incredibly-talented front end coworkers, in order to share both the work that I'm doing, and the work of the amazing artists that are in my life.

My twin brother is an amazing and underrated artist. You can find his gallery <a href="/nate_portfolio">here</a> (still yet to be built out lol)

My fiance, Rachel, is also (insert positive things here & some funny remark or two)

...and wait - there's more!

THIS IS ALL IN FRIGGIN MDX AND THAT MAKES ME SO DANG HAPPY! :cheer: :applaud: :bogus_thingy:
